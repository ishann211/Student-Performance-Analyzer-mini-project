# Student-Performance-Analyzer-mini-project

Predicting student academic outcomes from demographic, behavioral, and past performance data can facilitate early interventions. This study integrates the UCI Student Performance Datasets (Mathematics and Portuguese) for a combined analysis. We preprocess and merge the two datasets (382 overlapping students), train models to predict G3Math, where prior period grades (G1, G2 in both subjects) are key features, and train using Random Forest and SVR regressors. After tuning, a bagged set of Random Forests significantly improves performance, achieving R2 ≈ 0.917, RMSE ≈ 1.358. We discuss data pre-processing, feature importance, feature selection, feature extraction, evaluation metrics, ensemble learning, and the value of cross-validation.
